            Well i made it 1200 miles already, and i paused through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li> 
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li> 
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li> 
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li> 
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        </ul>
<!--unordered list(ul), ordered list(ol), list item(li) (all of these, ul, ol, and li are block elements 
like p, h1, h2, blockquote cause they automatically add a linebreak)-->
<!--you can nest lists!!! -->

            I saw some Burma Shave style signs pn the side of the road today:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <br>"Passing cars,<br>when you can't see,<br>May 
            get you,<br>a glimpse,<br>of eternity."<br> 
        </blockquote>
<!--so this is used for paragraphs, bunch of quotes. you gotta make a separate block for this but for q, used for 
single line quotes, you can include in the running text and not make a separate block like for blockquote-->
        <p>
            <br>I definitely won't be passing any cars.
        </p>

            My first day of the trip! I can't believe finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because i'm on
            a Segway, i wasn't able to bring a lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just
            the essentials. As Lao Tzu would've said,<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway</q>
            notice how it is different when we put double quotes ourselves: "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway"
<!-- <q> adds structure, it notifies the web page that it is  quote. very useful for formatting stuff-->

<!--p, h1, h2 are all elements, and so is br and <img>, but a void element-->
